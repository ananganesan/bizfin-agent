# 🔒 SSL/HTTPS Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done:
1. **Expanded SSL Certificate**: Added `bizfin.texra.in` to existing wildcard certificate
2. **Automatic HTTPS Redirect**: HTTP traffic now redirects to HTTPS
3. **Secure Connection**: Your app now has a valid SSL certificate

## 🌐 Your Secure Finance Advisory Agent:

### **Primary URL (HTTPS - Recommended):**
**https://bizfin.texra.in**

### **Login Page:**
**https://bizfin.texra.in/login.html**

## 🔐 Demo Credentials:
- **Junior Staff**: `junior_user` / `junior123`
- **Intermediate Staff**: `intermediate_user` / `junior123`
- **Department Head**: `department_head` / `junior123`

## 🎯 Why HTTPS Fixed the Redirect Issue:
- The main `texra.in` config was catching HTTP traffic
- HTTPS creates a separate server block with higher specificity
- Your `bizfin.texra.in` now has its own secure SSL endpoint

## ✅ Security Features Now Active:
- 🔒 **SSL/TLS Encryption** (Let's Encrypt certificate)
- 🛡️ **Security Headers** (XSS protection, frame options, content type)
- 🔄 **Automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirect**
- 📊 **HTTP/2 support** for faster loading

## 🧪 Test Your Secure App:
1. Visit: **https://bizfin.texra.in**
2. Should automatically redirect from HTTP
3. Login with demo credentials
4. Upload the `sample-data.csv` file
5. Ask AI questions about financial data

## 🎉 Result:
Your Business Finance Advisory Agent is now:
- ✅ **Secure** (HTTPS with valid certificate)
